## Introduction

An exploration of further analysis that could be used for TEF, following 
_Evidencing teaching excellence: Analysis of the TEF2 provider submissions_,
by Joanne Moore, Louise Higham and 
John Sanders (ARC Network), in partnership with Steven Jones, Duygy Candarli 
(University of Manchester) and Anna Mountford-Zimdars (University of Exeter).
[[1](#references)]

The Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) is a major policy initiative in higher 
education. Moore, Higham and Sanders (2017) explain how the submissions made
by providers as part of the TEF Year Two (TEF2) process have been used as a 
detailed source of evidence for excellence in teaching and impact evaluation 
practice. The Higher Education Academy (HEA) commissioned a research team to 
devise and undertake a data mining process on the text content of each 
submission. The results provided an initial guidance of a gold, silver or 
bronze award, some of which were adjusted by a panel before deciding a final 
outcome (Kernohan 2017) [[4](#references)].

There are further data mining techniques and visualisation tools which
can be used to study the submission texts in the following ways:

 1. To look at what UK education institutions are saying as a whole.
 2. To compare statements of institutions by the award they were given.
 3. To compare statements of higher and further education levels.

These findings may be able to assist or guide future work. The R programming 
language has been used to prepare and analyse the data files.

## Method

The TEF2 statement texts and award data were downloaded from
_Office for Students_. [[2](#references)] These data files are available in 
CSV and/or Excel format. The statements were available in PDF format.  

LDA (Latent Direchlet Allocation), a topic modelling technique, is 
used to analyse the statements. It has been used in previous work (Poon 2018)  [[3](#references)]. 
The statements are then taken through a series of pre-processing steps 
including stemming and removing stop-words, then the LDA process 
('_text2vec_') is applied. The pre-processing could be further improved 
after running the LDA process the first time, by customising the list of 
stop-words, or by tokenising instead of stemming.

The LDA process aims to identify topics that are covered in one or more 
documents by looking at the frequency and co-occurance of words. A 
hyper-parameter for this model, 'number of latent topics', was set to 50.

Two output matrices are produced:

 - A list of 50 keywords for each of the topics selected
 - The probability of relevance of each topic in each document

The six most likely keywords are shown in the analyses below. These lists are 
useful for identifying garbage terms, which would be removed if re-running 
the process. The identified topics may include terms which a human can identify 
as being related to the same real topic. Some that arise may make no logical 
sense to a human.

The '_LDAvis_' software is used to visualise the topics, which terms have been 
identified, and how the topics relate to each other (their proximity on the 
intertopic distance maps, topics with more terms in common appear closer).
Looking at the _LDAvis_ output can help to further refine the process.

After running the LDA process on the whole set of documents, it was broken 
down by the gold, silver and bronze awarded institutions, with a visualisation 
for each. It was also broken down by higher and further education institutions.

## Analysis

### Most salient terms
These terms are most important within the identified topics.

|Rank|	🇬🇧Whole |🥇Gold	|🥈Silver|🥉Bronze|🏨HEI | 🏫 FEC |
|---:|--------|-------|-------|------|----|-----|
|1	|student	|student|	student|	student|univers|colleg |
|2|	univers|	univers|	univers	|colleg|student|student |
|3	|colleg	|teach	|colleg|	univers|teach |learn |
|4	|learn	|colleg	|learn|	teach|learn|educ |
|5	|support	|learn	|teach	|progamm|employ |support |

### Most frequent terms

These terms are most frequent, regardless of topics.

|Rank|	🇬🇧Whole |🥇Gold	|🥈Silver|🥉Bronze|🏨HEI | 🏫FEC |
|---:|--------|-------|-------|------|----|-----|
|1	|student	|student	|student	|student| student|  student|
|2	|univers	|univers	|learn	|learn|univers| colleg|
|3	|learn	|support	|univers	|colleg|learn | support|
|4	|support	|teach	|develop	|support|support | learn|
|5	|teach	|learn	|teach	|develop| teach | develop|

- All institutions talk about students more than anything else.
- HEI insitutions talk about universities, while LEC institutions talk about colleges, as one might expect (although this could be when they mention their own name)
- HEI institutions talk more about employment/employability and teaching than FEC.
- All institutions talk about teaching and/or learning a lot.
- Gold and bronze institutions talk a lot about support.

### Major topics
These are the six most salient terms from each of the five 'largest' topics
for each study. 

- The tables are excerpts from the `*_word_vectors_for_each_topic.csv` files.
- The charts are intertopic distance maps where each circle is a topic and
topic 1 is coloured red. Topics with similar terms appear close on the chart.
- See the visualisations for each study for interactive maps and tables with percentages.

- Much overlap between topics.
- Would need to look further at all 50 topics to find ones that are clearer.

## Conclusions

- LDA analysis can help to further understand the results as a whole.
- We can be reassured that the process confirms the most obvious expectations (the main focus is students, teaching and learning).
- We can begin to identify topics but there is much overlap.
- So far, there are no outstanding differences between gold, silver and bronze awarded institutions.
- More work is required to refine the process; it might work better if the data set was larger or if the pre-processing was customised further.
- We could extend to look at multiple years of submissions.
